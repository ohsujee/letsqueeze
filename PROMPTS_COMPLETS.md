others pointing excitedly at contestants, mixture of sitting/standing creating organic crowd energy.
Multiple rows of audience members creating depth and scale - pure live show excitement.

Strong diagonal spotlight beams (5-6 beams) cutting through the scene from ceiling,
each beam targeting and illuminating the contestants at their podiums and the host -
creating dramatic focused TV studio lighting on the performers. The beams create
visible cones of light highlighting each contestant and the host center stage.

the light beams, catching highlights. Circular pools of vibrant light on stage floor
beneath each contestant and host, reinforcing their spotlight moments.

atmosphere, host commanding the stage while contestants compete, crowd reacting to
every moment. Like being on a primetime network game show with roaring spectators.
