and back of the studio. Crowd in highly varied animated poses: standing ovations with arms waving,
jumping up from seats, bodies turned fully toward stage, some clapping overhead,
others pointing excitedly at contestants, mixture of sitting/standing creating organic crowd energy.
Multiple rows of audience members creating depth and scale - pure live show excitement.

Strong diagonal spotlight beams (5-6 beams) cutting through the scene from ceiling,
each beam targeting and illuminating the contestants at their podiums and the host -
creating dramatic focused TV studio lighting on the performers. The beams create
visible cones of light highlighting each contestant and the host center stage.
Dense confetti pieces (rectangles and small strips) - 30-40 pieces - falling through
the light beams, catching highlights. Circular pools of vibrant light on stage floor
beneath each contestant and host, reinforcing their spotlight moments.
Deep stage perspective showing packed audience sections.

Scene composition: Memory game show — three individual contestant podiums side by side,
viewed from the front at eye level. Each podium has its own glowing screen panel
embedded in the front face, visible and lit for all three players simultaneously.

Key elements:
- 3 simplified stylized figures standing behind their podiums, clearly distinct silhouettes:
  left figure with long flowing hair, right figure with short curly hair, center figure with
  medium hair — varied heights, different body shapes, all clearly recognizable as distinct people.
  NOT bald silhouettes — hair shape is essential to distinguish the characters.
- Expressive, fun body language — this is a party game, not a funeral:
    • Left player: arms raised mid-celebration, just slammed their answer in, pure joy
    • Center player: face of exaggerated comic concentration — leaning way forward,
      both fists clenched on the podium, tongue-biting focus but clearly playful
    • Right player: hand on head in "oh no I forgot!" gesture, body tilted with surprised energy
- All three podiums have an identically styled glowing screen panel facing the viewer,
  each showing a 4x4 grid. Center screen has a bold pattern of lit cyan cells (active challenge),
  left screen shows a completed pattern (winner), right screen shows a scrambled/blank state.
  Three screens, three podiums — no exceptions.

static emotionless poses, horror-movie tension.

## DAILY CARDS — FORMAT SPÉCIFIQUE

> Ces cards sont **horizontales et petites** (environ 3:1 de ratio).
> Pas de personnages. Le visuel = la mécanique du jeu. Doit être lisible à thumbnail.
> Style: graphic, bold, abstract — pas de scène narrative.

---

## 7. MOT MYSTÈRE (Daily Card)

```
Art style: Bold graphic illustration for a compact horizontal mobile game card.
High contrast, strong shapes, immediately readable at small size.
Abstract and symbolic — no characters, no scene, pure visual metaphor for the game mechanic.
Rich saturated colors, dramatic lighting from within the graphic elements themselves.
Clean negative space — the key visual breathes.

Technical: 16:9 aspect ratio, minimum 2400×1350px resolution.
The composition must use the full height — key visual elements distributed vertically,
not squeezed into a thin horizontal band. Clear center focal point.
Every element serves legibility at thumbnail size. No clutter.

STRICT RULES:
- NO characters or silhouettes
- NO text, letters, or words — even suggesting letters is forbidden
- NO busy patterns or textures
- NO random decorative elements

---

Scene: A Wordle-style letter grid — 5 columns × 5 rows of clean square tiles,
slightly perspective-angled (15–20° tilt) to give depth. The grid is tall enough to
fill the vertical space — tiles are large, not miniaturized. The grid occupies 70–80%
of the frame height so it doesn't look like a thin strip in a wide image.

Tile states creating a readable story:
- Top two rows: tiles in neutral dark gray (empty/absent states)
- Third row: mix of yellow-gold tiles (present, wrong position) and gray
- Bottom row: ALL FIVE TILES bright emerald green — the winning row, the solved word

The green bottom row glows intensely, casting green light downward and onto surrounding tiles.
Each tile is a clean flat square with subtle rounded corners and a thin inner border.
Tiles in the winning row slightly enlarged or lifted — celebrating the find.

Background: Deep dark emerald (#022c22) fading to near-black at edges.
Radial glow of bright #10b981 centered on the green bottom row, spreading outward.

Lighting: The green tiles ARE the light source — no external lighting needed.
Green glow reflects onto neighboring tiles and background, creating depth purely through light.

Mood: That perfect moment of solving — clean, satisfying, triumphant but restrained.
Like the Wordle win screen distilled into a single graphic frame.

Color palette: Near-black (#0a0f0d), Deep emerald (#022c22), Mid emerald (#059669),
Bright emerald (#10b981), Gold-yellow (#fbbf24) for present tiles.

AVOID: Actual letters on tiles, text of any kind, characters, random sparkles,
cluttered composition, tiles that don't look like a word grid.
```

## 8. SÉMANTIQUE (Daily Card)

```
Art style: Bold graphic illustration for a compact horizontal mobile game card.
High contrast, strong shapes, immediately readable at small size.
Abstract and symbolic — no characters, no scene, pure visual metaphor for temperature and proximity.
Rich saturated colors, dramatic lighting. Clean negative space.

Technical: 16:9 aspect ratio, minimum 2400×1350px resolution.
The composition must use the full height — the heat field should expand vertically,
not be a thin horizontal stripe. Clear center focal point.
Every element serves legibility at thumbnail size. No clutter.

STRICT RULES:
- NO characters or silhouettes
- NO text or words — abstract shapes only
- NO thermometer icon or literal temperature symbols
- NO busy patterns or textures
- NO random decorative elements

---

Scene: A radial heat field — an abstract gradient circle or oval centered in the frame,
representing the semantic proximity space. The center burns bright orange-white (100°C, the target),
radiating outward through orange → amber → yellow → cool blue → cold dark blue at the edges.

On this heat field: 6–8 small abstract word-blob shapes (simple rounded rectangles or organic blobs,
NO text inside) arranged at different distances from the hot center:
- 1–2 blobs very close to center, glowing orange-hot
- 2–3 blobs mid-distance, amber/warm
- 2–3 blobs at the cold edge, blue-gray and dim
The blobs vary in size slightly — closer ones feel heavier, hotter, more energized.

The hot center itself: a bright starburst or radial pulse of white-orange light,
suggesting the hidden target word radiating heat outward. Not a specific icon — pure light.

Background: Deep dark (#1a0800) almost black with warm undertone, vignette edges.

Lighting: The heat field is the light source. Hot center casts orange glow on nearby blobs.
Edge blobs sit in cool shadow. Strong contrast between hot core and cold periphery.

Mood: The thrill of getting warmer — abstract, mysterious, irresistibly compelling.
Like a heatmap that hides something precious at its burning center.

Color palette: Near-black (#1a0800), Deep orange (#9a3412), Bright orange (#f97316),
Amber (#fbbf24), Cool blue (#3b82f6), Ice (#bfdbfe).

AVOID: Thermometer icon, literal temperature symbols, text in any form, characters,
symmetric decorative patterns, busy composition, anything too literal or illustrative.
